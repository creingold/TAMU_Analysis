To Do list

154Sm data, look into polarization data
	- Find strong lines of E1 and E2 , try E0 or M1 if find lines with decent intensity.
	- Plot data that scattered along and perp. to reaction plane.
	- Triple check clover orientation
	- Run gauss+lin fitting over large peaks
	- Integrate the fit
	- subtract the areas under the curves, print to another histogram or tree or something
	- Calculate difference divided by sum for along and perp. for every strong gamma
	- Find correction factor for polarizations
		- Look at data from just a source to see if there is a preference in the way the gammas are scattering
	- Use this to calibrate things from before.
